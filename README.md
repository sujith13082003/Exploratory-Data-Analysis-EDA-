# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Let's conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Planets dataset, available from the Seaborn library. This dataset contains information about exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) and their discovery methods.

**EDA Objectives**
1.Data Overview
2.Missing Value Analysis
3.Univariate Analysis – Histograms, Boxplots
4.Outlier Detection
5.Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis – Pairplots, Heatmaps
6.Correlation Matrix
7.Summary of Key Insights

**Aspect - Insights**
Missing Data - Significant missing values in mass and orbital_period
Discovery Methods -	Radial Velocity and Transit are most common
Distribution - mass, orbital_period, and distance are highly skewed
Outliers - Present in almost all numerical features
Relationships - 	No strong linear correlation between most features
Temporal Trend - Rapid increase in discoveries post-2000, especially via Transit
